## Problem Statement
# Housing Development Board (HDB)
HDB manages over 2000 carparks, with more than 660k car parks and 7000 equipment that supports the operations of the carpark. Our car parks are visited by 500k unique motorists and the system processes 2.5m transactions daily. It is not possible for HDB to deploy staff/maintenance teams to be at every car park, due to the sheer number of car parks and equipment. Also, the situation is exacerbated by the manpower crunch brought about by our aging population. Hence, we are looking for a solution that allows HDB to rely on the residents to take ownership of their estateâ€™s well-being, and partner HDB to improve the estate.

 Objective: To leverage on technology (mobile app, crowdsourcing, etc) to create a fun and engaging solution that allows residents to check on HDB car parks, monitor the maintenance/rectification progress if any and take ownership for the well-being of their estate
